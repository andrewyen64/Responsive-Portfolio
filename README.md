## Description

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
The goal of this project is to create multiple html pages with responsive design to fit 980px, 768px and 640px width screens.
Also through Bootstrap's resources, a functional navbar is on each page and a form (purely for aesthetics) is on the contact's page.

Note: This project's portfolio page currently only has placeholders. In the future, I will update it with links to the actual finished applications in my current up to date portfolio, which is available in my Github profile.
