# Responsive Portfolio

## Responsive Design

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
The goal of this project is to create multiple html pages with responsive design to fit 980px, 768px and 640px width screens.
Also through Bootstrap's resources, a functional navbar is on each page and a form on the contact's page.

* Note: The portfolio page currently has placeholders and should be updated with links to actual live projects once they are completed.
